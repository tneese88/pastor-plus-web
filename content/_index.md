title: "Pastor Plus"
description: "Strengthening pastors through sound theological resources."
---

Pastor Plus is a program that connects supporters in the United States with pastors and potential ministry workers in **Poland** who need access to trustworthy theological training resources. Through a simple monthly partnership, you help place doctrinally solid books directly into the hands of those charged with preaching the Word and shepherding Christ's church.

---

## How It Works

1. **You give monthly** ($30 or $40).  
2. **We translate, print, and ship** carefully selected theological books into the pastor's own language.  
3. **Pastors provide simple accountability** by writing **four sentences each month** on how the book has helped their ministry.

This program is intended for **pastors and potential ministry workers** not for general distribution.

## Monthly Partnership Options

### $30 / month — Pastor Package
- The pastor receives **one translated book every month** in his own language.

### $40 / month — Pastor + Spouse Package

## Accountability

We want the program to be faithful and fruitful. Each month, participating pastors submit a short **four-sentence reflection** describing how the book has helped their ministry. This provides accountability and encourages thoughtful, practical use of the material.
