**What do we Do?**

Pastor Plus exists to place trustworthy, doctrinally solid books into the hands of pastors and ministry workers in Poland. Many labor faithfully with limited access to biblical training. Through monthly support, believers in the United States can provide pastors with resources that help them preach the Word, shepherd the flock, and equip the saints.
